## 🔮 Potential Future Enhancements

The frontend of this application is fully functional and "full-stack ready." The next logical step would be to connect it to a real backend.

*   **Backend & Database:** Build a REST API using Node.js/Express.js and connect it to a database (like PostgreSQL or MongoDB) to persist all data.
*   **Real-Time Notifications:** Integrate a service like Socket.io or an email/SMS provider to send real-time notifications to students when their reserved book becomes available.
*   **Advanced Search:** Implement a more powerful search functionality, allowing filtering by publication date, author, and more.
*   **Unit & Integration Testing:** Add a test suite using a framework like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the application remains stable and bug-free.
